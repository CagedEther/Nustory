# The Nustory Innovation Lab

Welcome to the Nustory Innovation Lab, where you can explore strategies for infusing AI into marketing. The lab is built on principles of Open Innovation and is a collaboration between business and academia with the goal of advancing the field and building skills. 

Nustory runs academic projects which pair business students with startups or non-profits over semester-long engagements with hands-on learning. See this [case study with University of Miami](Case_Study_Miami_BFI.md) for an example of a project in action.
